# evemail-gmail
Evemail to gmail uploader.



Requirements:
    python 2.7

    pip install evelink

    pip install google-api-python-client


API key with mail, mail body, and mailing list. That's a mask of 3584


Set up project with credentials with access to the gmail api at:

https://console.developers.google.com/

Download the credential file, and save it as client_secret.json in the directory with the rest of the files. (do not commit it to a copy)

once you have python downloaded, and the modules installed with pip (which may not be in your path. c:\python27\scripts\pip is a common location)

* download the files from here, and stick them in a directory somewhere
* make sure you put the client_secret.json in with them
* fill the details into the conf file
* start a command prompt (if you hold shift and right click in the directory, you should get an option to start a command prompt there)
* python uploader.py
* The first time it runs, it'll open a browser and get you to select the account and accept the privileges for insertion. After that, it'll run on cached credentials
* Then it should start inserting mail into your gmail account, under the eve label.
